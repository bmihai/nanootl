# nanootl
Vim plugin to highlight entire lines by indentation level like vimoutliner. It is 100-1000x faster than vimoutliner when opening very large files, but it has no other features besides line highlighting.

It activates on files with the ".not" extension. Identation can be either spaces- or tabs-based, but not a mixed style on the same line.

If you would like some other vimoutliner-like feature added, let me know.
