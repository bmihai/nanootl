# Nano otl
Vim plugin that colors entire lines by their indentation level. It is like vimoutliner, but 100-1000x faster when opening large files. It lacks any other features besides the very simple line highlighting.

It activates on files with the ".not" extension. Identation can be either tabs- or spaces-based (4 per tab), but not a combination of them on a single line. At any indentation level, beginning a line with a single space assigns it a special "subtext" green highlighting.

If you would like to see some other feature added please use the issue tracker on https://github.com/bmihai/nanootl.
